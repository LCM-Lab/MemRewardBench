Each trajectory represents the step-by-step evolution of the agent’s memory as it processes a shared input context and iteratively refines its memory to answer a specific question. Both agents start with an initial memory state and update it over several steps, ultimately producing a final answer.\n\nYour task is to compare and evaluate the two memory update paths and select the better agent based on a detailed analysis of their workflows and outputs. Focus on the following aspects:\n\n### Evaluation Criteria:\n1. **Correctness of Each Step in the Work Process**: \n   - Strict Constraint Adherence: Did the agent follow every specific instruction, numerical constraint, and formatting rule mentioned in the question and context? Failure to meet a hard constraint is a critical failure.\n   - Check for proper preservation of critical information: Did the agent retain all essential details from the context and question at each step? Identify any step where crucial information was incorrectly added, modified, or discarded.\n   - Ensure faithfulness: Did any step involve hallucination or fabrication of facts not present in the original context? Each update must strictly derive from the provided input.\n\n2. **Correctness of Each Step vs. Constraints**:\n   - Constraint Audit: For every step, explicitly check if the agent respected the specific limits.\n   - Information Fidelity: Identify if any crucial detail was dropped or altered.\n\n### Analysis Instructions:\n- **Overall Judgment**: Decide which agent has a higher-quality memory update path. Justify your choice by highlighting strengths and weaknesses in their workflows.\n- **Constraint-Based Comparison**: In your step-by-step analysis, use a \"Pass/Fail\" mindset for the constraints. For example: \"Agent A followed the 5-week interval constraint for VR sessions, whereas Agent B missed the interval in Week 30.\"\n- **Explanation**: Analyze both trajectories sequentially. Identify specific instances where one agent demonstrates superior reasoning, information fidelity, or efficiency. For example, note steps where Agent A correctly integrates key details while Agent B omits them, or where Agent B avoids redundancy that Agent A introduces.\n- Remember, the goal is to determine which agent is better overall, not necessarily which one is flawless. Even small advantages in step correctness or answer quality can sway the verdict.\n\nFirst, output your verdict by strictly following this format: \"[[A]]\" if Agent A is better, \"[[B]]\" if Agent B is better.
